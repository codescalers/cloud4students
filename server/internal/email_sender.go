		I really don't think this is the right way to use the validator. If you gonna call
		a validator on specific value with a function then why bother defining custom validators
		with the validator package.

		according to the docs, the validator package is mainly used to add validation annotation on structures
		so for example
		type Config struct{
			Email string `validate:"email"`
		}

		then when let's say u have
		config := //load config

		then do
		validator.Validate(config)

		this will then run validation on all the struct fields based on given config given that
		there is a validator registered with name `email`

		If this is not how u using validator then it's an over kill to just call the ValidateMail function
		directly this way (which has to do reflection!)
